- What is object-oriented programming (OOP)? 
 Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
@EASY
- What is a class in Java? 
 In Java, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class can have.
@EASY
- What is encapsulation in Java? 
 Encapsulation is the mechanism in Java that bundles data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together within a class, allowing access to the data only through the defined methods. It helps in achieving data hiding and abstraction.
@EASY
- What is inheritance in Java? 
 Inheritance is a feature in Java that allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes. It promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.
@EASY
- What is polymorphism in Java? 
 Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on different forms. In Java, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling methods to be invoked dynamically at runtime.
@HARD
- What are the access modifiers in Java? 
 Java provides four access modifiers: public, protected, private, and the default (no modifier). They determine the accessibility of classes, methods, and variables in different contexts.
@EASY
- What is an interface in Java? 
 An interface in Java defines a contract or a set of methods that a class implementing the interface must provide. It enables multiple inheritance-like behavior and supports abstraction.
@EASY
- What is the difference between composition and inheritance? 
 Composition and inheritance are two ways to establish relationships between classes. Composition involves creating objects of other classes within a class, whereas inheritance involves deriving a class from a base class to inherit its properties and methods.
@HARD
- What is the purpose of the super keyword in Java? 
 In Java, the super keyword is used to refer to the superclass (parent class) of a subclass. It is used to call the superclass's constructor or access its methods and variables.
@HARD
- What are the SOLID principles in object-oriented design? 
 The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that aim to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They include Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.
