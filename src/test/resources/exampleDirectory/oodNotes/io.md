# IO
Different sources for input: Touch, key press, mouse, camera, audio, network, etc.

Streaming IO: Some program is sitting in the middle of bytes flowing towards it and outputting away from it



[[System.in - stdin]] [[connected to the system’s standard input stream (usually the keyboard)]]

[[System.out - stdout]] [[connected to system’s standard output stream (usually some type of terminal)]]

System.err - stderr - connected to the systems standard error stream … a good place to send error messages


[[Why have both out and err? :::
You don't want to torment your user with error messages]], maybe send them somewhere else like a torrent/file



## File I/O

[[Files - usually stored on non-volatile memory]]

[[Able to store data that lives beyond the current execution]] of a program

File can be of numerous different… meaning ways of interpreting the information stored on disk
[[What are some types of Files?:::
tex: ASCII, UTF-8, etc... 
mp4, wav, 
jpeg, gif, png, svg…]]
